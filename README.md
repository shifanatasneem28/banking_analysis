# banking_analysis

In our project, we analyzed data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called BankMarketing Data Set. The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese Banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be (’yes’) or not (’no’) subscribed. There were available four datasets,we chose bank-full.csv data set, which contains all examples for the older version of this dataset.

Banking - Analysis of Bank Marketing. The bank direct marketing data analysis is important work that helps the banks predict whether customers will sign long term deposits with the banks. The method that can predict such customers' needs can be profitable to the banks for improving their marketing campaign strategies.
